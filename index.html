  <h1>An intro to my own intro to HTML</h1>
	Greetings!  My name is Montana H. Queen, young adult currently attending the
  University at Buffalo.  I'm majoring in Computer Science, but I'm not yet sure
  of what I want my career to be.  MAybe cyber security?  Cyber Security sounds
  pretty cool.  I enjoy coding and programming in general, despite the guarenteed
  aches that come along with it.  But in the end, it's worth it when you know what
  you have the ability to create.  HTML was the one language I wanted to learn ever
  since I was about twelve years old.  It was the first language I was introduced
  to, and I was hooked pretty quickly.  I wanted to creat websites immediately,
  but I knew that my knowledge of it wasn't enough to go forth with it.  Then,
  later on, I was introduced to other languages that would allow me to do more than
  designing websites.  But it is still something I wanted to do, and found several
  base programs that would assist newbies just like, along with plenty of tutorials.
  So I was able to take a class in high school where I learned the basics of
  everything, but I knew there was still more to it.  I know I still have plenty
  to learn even now, but as you can see, I'm moving further along!

  <h2>My Interests and Activities</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Another thing I always wanted to get into was game design, but that dream fell
  short for personal reasons.  Despite that, I still play around with free
  programs that allow people to build indie, or independent, games.  I also spend
my free time playing them too.  If I'm not playing games myslef, I'm watching
someone on YouTube play them.</li>

  <li>I enjoy being outdoors, my main favorite outdoor activities are kayaking,
    fishing, boating, gardening, or just relaxing in the shade./li>

  <li>I also love animals, I have a small dog of my own, so I sometimes read
      up on various creatures.  My most recent obsession is a Sea Nettle
      jellyfish.</li>

  <li>I enjoy art, whether it is sketching, drawing, painting, and such, so
    also do that in my free time.  I love looking at other people's works,
    especially webcomics, and I plan on making a webcomic myself.
